The repository for the OC Battle card game. 

To setup, install Anaconda 3, and then install all the requirements:

discord.py - pip install discord.py,

opencv - pip install opencv-python, 

Download the env file from the discord #programming channel, and move it to the base directory. Rename it from env to .env. Then navigate to this base directory using the Anaconda prompt. Execute the bot software with python run.py to initialize the bot in the AniAnt bot server.
