In the far depths of the ocean, the rare and delicious pufferfish can oft be found swimming happily along the waters. What makes these fish so special is their uncanny ability to blow up their bodies into an inflated, more intimidating form to ward off potential predators. Much like the pufferfish, the equally rare and delicious Inflation Alex can inflate and make himself larger in an attempt to deter rabid Twitter followers. Whether or not his inflation technique works as a deterrent or simply attracts more followers in this case is another question entirely.
